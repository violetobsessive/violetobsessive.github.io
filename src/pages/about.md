Heya, I'm Jie! (Or you can call me Frances, the name comes from the film 'Frances Ha'). I'm a software developer based in London atm :)

Being a liberal arts student in languages and journalism for the first 23 years of my life is extremely rewarding. It made me appreaciate the power of words and structure, and help me make sense of the world in a profound way.

These aesthetic standards extends to areas such as architecture, graphic design, animations, video editing etc. I then quickly got facscinated by the world of games, which is a combination of all of these sub-genres.

As Covid hit, I was bored at home and accidentally got into 3D modeling and animations in Blender. Then game design and development in Unity and C#. That's where everything started.

Now I work in Finance, building modern platforms that facilitates metals trading with LME (London Metal Exchange). Currently working in C# and .NET, occasionally in TypeScript, React and GraphQL. It might sound soul crushingly boring, yet it's actually a lot more intersting than it sounds!

Now that I've made this 'tech blog', coding has become part of my personality, and I do it after work for fun. But trust me, I do have other interests (maybe too much) in life.

When I'm not coding, you can find me practising keyboard/guitar, hiking in the countryside, travelling with a budget, learning languages for nothing, being obsessed with 3D printing, crocheting (never finished any ambitious piece I planned), walking in the same local park for the 267th time, or just doom scrolling cat videos in bed.

Butter the toast, eat the toast, shit the toast.

I'm just a normal, functioning memebr of the human race who's trying to make ends meet. There is no way anyone can prove otherwise.
